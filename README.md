# Chef Infra Extension for Visual Studio Code

The Chef Infra Extension for Visual Studio Code offers rich language support for Chef Infra DSL and snippets when using [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com).

![install and demo](https://github.com/chef/vscode-chef/raw/master/images/vscode-chef-install.gif)

## Features

#### Syntax/keyword highlighting:

 * Chef Infra Recipe DSL
 * Chef Infra built-in Resources
 * Chef Infra Custom Resources

#### Cookstyle linting and source analysis:

 * Enabled by default (disable by adding ```{ "rubocop.enable": false }``` in user/workspace settings) and activated when the first Ruby file is loaded.
 * The entire repo will be linted when files are saved.
 * If you have [Chef Workstation](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-workstation) installed, linting should "just work" on Windows, macOS and Linux. [Cookstyle](https://github.com/chef/cookstyle) will be used by default.
 * If you do not have Chef Workstation but do have Rubocop installed, you can set the executable path by setting ```{ "rubocop.path": "c:\\path\\to\\rubocop.bat"}``` in user/workspace settings).
 * To override the config file used by Rubocop/Cookstyle, use the ```{ "rubocop.configFile": "path/to/config.yml" }``` in user/workspace settings.

#### Snippet support (with tabbing) for all Chef Infra built-in Resources:

 * Please review the [Resource snippets](snippets/chef_resources.json) for a complete list.

#### Snippet support (with tabbing) for all Chef Infra Metadata fields:

 * Please review the [Metadata snippets](snippets/chef_metadata.json) for a complete list.

#### Snippet support (with tabbing) for all Chef Infra DSL methods included in chef-utils:

 * Please review the [DSL snippets](snippets/chef_utils.json) for a complete list.
