# Progress Chef Infra Extension for Visual Studio Code

The Progress Chef Infra Extension for Visual Studio Code offers rich language support for Chef Infra and Chef InSpec when using [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com).

![install and demo](https://github.com/chef/vscode-chef/raw/master/images/vscode-chef-install.gif)

## Features

### Syntax/keyword highlighting

* Chef Infra Language (traditional and YAML-based) including built-in resources
* Chef Infra Custom Resources
* Chef InSpec

### Cookstyle linting and source analysis

* Enabled by default (disable by adding ```{ "rubocop.enable": false }``` in user/workspace settings) and activated when the first Ruby file is loaded.
* The entire repo will be linted when files are saved, unless there are more than 400 `*.rb` files in the workspace, in which case only open files will be linted. Adjust this threshold using the ```{ "rubocop.fileCountThreshold": 400 }``` setting in user/workspace settings.
* You may lint the entire workspace, even if it is larger than the above threshold, using the `Chef: Validate Entire Workspace` command from the Command Pallette.
* If you have [Chef Workstation](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-workstation) installed, linting should "just work" on Windows, macOS, and Linux. [Cookstyle](https://github.com/chef/cookstyle) will be used by default.
* If you do not have Chef Workstation but do have Rubocop installed, you can set the executable path by setting ```{ "rubocop.path": "c:\\path\\to\\rubocop.bat"}``` in user/workspace settings).
* To override the config file used by Rubocop/Cookstyle, use the ```{ "rubocop.configFile": "path/to/config.yml" }``` in user/workspace settings.

#### Autogenerated Snippet Updates

The directory `autogeneration` located within this project contains tooling which is used to perform updates on autogenerated Snippet data.

* From a terminal, `cd` to the `autogeneration` directory:

    ```sh
    cd ./autogeneration
    ```

* Verify that local Ruby gems which are required for Snippet updates have been installed (defined within `./autogeneration/Gemfile`):

    ```sh
    bundle install
    ```

    ```plain
    $ bundle install
    Using rake 13.0.3
    Using bundler 2.1.4
    Using concurrent-ruby 1.1.8
    Using chef-utils 17.2.11 from https://github.com/chef/chef (at master@0af4909)
    Using coderay 1.1.3
    Using method_source 1.0.0
    Using pry 0.14.1
    Using yard 0.9.26
    Bundle complete! 4 Gemfile dependencies, 8 gems now installed.
    Bundled gems are installed into `./vendor`
    ```

* Run Rake task `generate_snippets` to perform any required Snippet updates, which are handled via autogeneration process:

    ```sh
    rake generate_snippets
    ```

### Packaging/releasing
