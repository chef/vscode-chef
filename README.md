 * Enabled by default (disable by adding ```{ "rubocop.enable": false }``` in user/workspace settings)
 * Entire repo will be linted when files are saved.
 * If you have the [ChefDK](http://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk) installed, linting should "just work" on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux (Ubuntu.) [Cookstyle](https://github.com/chef/cookstyle) will be used by default.
 * If you do not have the ChefDK but do have Rubocop installed, you can set the executable path by setting ```{ "rubocop.path": "c:\\path\\to\\rubocop.bat"}``` in user/workspace settings).

#### Foodcritic analysis (experimental):
 * Disabled by default (enable by adding ```{ "foodcritic.enable": true }``` in user/workspace settings)
 * When Ruby files are saved, the entire repo will be enumerated for cookbooks and Foodcritic run against each one.
 * If you have the [ChefDK](http://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk) installed, Foodcritic should "just work" on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux (Ubuntu)
 * If you do not have the ChefDK but do have Foodcritic installed, you can set the executable path by setting ```{ "foodcritic.path": "c:\\path\\to\\foodcritic.bat"}``` in user/workspace settings).
